Note: the primary difference between one-way function and finite
difference is that in one-way function we only plot the model response
w.r.t change in input or perturbation. On the other hand, in finite-
difference we estimate the gradient of the model response w.r.t
input perturbation.
Food for thought: cannot we estimate the gradient of model response
from the one-way function _artifacts ?
